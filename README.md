# Nikhil Analytics Camera EDA Project

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project conducted in Python focusing on a dataset of approximately 1000 cameras. The project aims to explore, clean, and derive insights from this dataset containing various properties such as weight, focal length, price, etc.

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1:** Create a DataFrame "Camera_data" using the provided "Camera.csv".
- **Task 2:** Find the percentage of blank values in each column.
- **Task 3:** View the statistical summary of the data.
- **Task 4:** Replace all blank values with NaN.
- **Task 5:** Replace blank values with respective column medians.
- **Task 6:** Add a new column "Discounted_Price" with a 5% discount on the Price column.
- **Task 7:** Drop columns "Zoom Tele" & "Macro Focus range".
- **Task 8:** Replace the Model Name "Agfa ePhoto CL50" with "Agfa ePhoto CL250".
- **Task 9:** Rename the column from "Release Date" to "Release Year".
- **Task 10:** Identify the most expensive camera.
- **Task 11:** Find the camera with the least weight.
- **Task 12:** Group the data based on release year.
- **Task 13:** Extract specific columns: Name, Storage Include, Price, Discounted_Price & Dimensions.
- **Task 14:** Extract records for cameras released in 2005 & 2006.
- **Task 15:** Identify the most expensive & cheapest camera in 2007.
- **Task 16:** Determine the year with the maximum number of models released.

## Files
